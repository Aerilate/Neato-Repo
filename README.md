## Description
Neato Repo is an image repository where users can upload files to a remote AWS S3 storage container. User login and sign-up is handled with Firebase Authentication. Once users are logged in, they can upload images from their computer. These uploaded images show up in the Personal Images section and are private by default. The user can choose to set permissions on individual images to public, which makes the image also show up in the Public Images section. Image permissions are saved with MongoDB. The user may also delete their images at any time. Users can only modify their own files.\

Public images can be seen from any other account. Here, the logged-in user B can see user A's public images:

## Design
The app is composed of four main components:
- Frontend website, built with React and Axios
- Firebase, for authentication
- Backend server, built with Node and Express
- MongoDB, for saving image permissions

A NoSQL DB was picked because I wanted this project's features to be easily changed and extended. Therefore, I didn't want to commit to a particular DB schema for this project and naturally NoSQL allows more flexibility than SQL in this aspect.
